Despite this I wanted to try out many different things the game had to\r\n        offer. Confident from my Tactician playthrough from the previous game, I started this game on Tactician mode as\r\n        well with an even mix of physical and magic damage dealers: one hydro/aero caster, one pyro/geo caster, one\r\n        ranger and one 2-handed warrior. It soon became apparent that was not a wise decision\r\n        as I was getting stomped as early as level 3. I resorted to save scumming and maximum terrain usage to barely\r\n        survive most of my encounters.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>As the game progressed the ranger played a more crucial role in terms of dealing damage, so my party played all\r\n        around him. The magic spells were often more useful outside of combat and mostly served to buff and\r\n        heal my party. Luckily the game does provide ways for my INT based characters to deal physical damage through\r\n        some of the necromancy spells that scale with INT. Likewise there are skills that deal magic damage but are\r\n        based off of STR. This provides a certain flexibility but those choices are very limited.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Having made many wrong decisions in the first hours of my game, I learned that it's possible to completely respec\r\n        all characters attributes, skills and talents for free! This allows you to change your mind and recustomize your\r\n        whole character as you see fit. The only caution is that you need to spend more gold learning spells for the new\r\n        specializations, though the old ones remain in your skillbook should you want to switch back. However, if you\r\n        invest in bartering and thievery then gold will not be a problem.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>I still decided to waddle my way through the game with my hybrid composition. There are rare moments where having\r\n        access to physical damage or magic damage helps immensely versus if you only had a specific damage type.\r\n        Examples are trolls that are weak to one specific element or enemies with a ton of physical armor and (almost)\r\n        no magic armor. But there were a lot of tough encounters where this setup felt impossible to win with. In\r\n        hindsight I do not recommend your first game to be on Tactician mode so you may get a feel for the game\r\n        mechanics first.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>All in all I enjoyed this game, perhaps even moreso than the Divinity Original Sin I.</p>\r\n</app-blog-post>\r\n","/**\n * @fileoverview This file was generated by the Angular template compiler.

You've got a mixture of quests\r\n        and combat from which you gain experience and gold. With these elements you progress your character and\r\n        gradually become more powerful as you uncover more of the plot. Even though this sounds familiar, they still\r\n        provide a very different player experience. I believe it comes from the difference in aesthetics of the\r\n        characters and landscape, but also from the ingame setting. The different take on how to present the game\r\n        visually by itself can provide a fresh feel for RPG veterans looking for something new.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>When you've played a couple of typical Western RPG's such as Skyrim, The Witcher 3\r\n        or any of the Gothic series you will notice many recurring elements that feel very similar: the environment\r\n        style, the character\r\n        progression, the combat, and so on. This makes sense since game companies analyze what appeals to players to\r\n        improve on their own game. However, the player base in Asia are a very different target audience than the\r\n        Western player base and this reflects in the sort of games that gets produced.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>For Chinese games, a world setting that involves martial arts is a common theme. In particular many games such as\r\n        Fate Seeker are inspired by elements from the novels of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_Yong\">famous\r\n            writer Jin Yong</a>. In these games the emphasis lies on strengthening your body through training and\r\n        breathing techniques. It's basically <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuxia\">a fantasy world (called\r\n            Wuxia)</a> where you can achieve Marvel-like superpowers through practices like Tai Chi.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Even though I am subtly recommending you to try this game and you may be compelled to, it will be difficult if\r\n        you do not master the Chinese language. The game does not provide an official English translation as of yet.\r\n        That is why I wish to start a <i>Let's Play</i> edition for this game. I am a novice in Chinese myself, hoping\r\n        to get some practice as I translate while playing the game for the first time. At the same time I can share my\r\n        experience with you. So let us start:</p>\r\n\r\n    <img class=\"img-fluid rounded mb-4\" src=\"assets/images/fate_seeker/intro/character_creation.png\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n    <p>I opted for aphabetical characters instead of a Chinese name to easily recognize my own name during dialogues. In\r\n        this case my surname is LP (from Let's Play) and my first name is FS (from Fate Seeker). On the bottom left is\r\n        my player's biography. It basically seems to say something along the lines that I am mediocre in terms of\r\n        ability and can easily become insignificant if I don't train myself. But with continuous effort it is possible\r\n        to achieve great heights.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>On the bottom right you can see 8 player stats. They are a bit different from the typical STR/DEX/INT stats in\r\n        Western RPG's.</p>\r\n\r\n    <table>\r\n        <tbody>\r\n        <tr>\r\n            <td>\r\n                <ng-piao-liang-hanzi chineseCharacters=\"çå½\"></ng-piao-liang-hanzi>\r\n            </td>\r\n            <td>These are your health points.

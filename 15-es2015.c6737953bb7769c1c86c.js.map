From the very first level you will have to rely on the manual that you get with the game. Although a\r\n        background in programming will help, this game is accessible to everyone with an interest\r\n        in problem solving. There are not that many commands (about 20) to learn either. In fact, the few amount of\r\n        commands will feel rather limiting quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The trick of the game will be to carry out 'advanced' computations with the limited commands and space available.\r\n        Even simple things like multiplication can become quite a challenge when only addition and subtraction are\r\n        available. Let's see an example:</p>\r\n\r\n    <img class=\"img-fluid rounded mb-4\" src=\"assets/images/tis100_lvl2_basic.png\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n    <p>This is the second level of the game. On the top left you see a description of what your program needs to do.\r\n        Below that you see two columns <b>IN.A</b> and <b>OUT.A</b> which correspond to the input and output of your\r\n        program respectively. In this case we need to get the input, double it and send it to the output.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>On the right side is the implemented solution. The <code class=\"github-code\">MOV</code> command takes two\r\n        parameters: the first one is the source\r\n        location to retrieve a value from and the second is the target location to move the value to. The box in the\r\n        middle of the upper row is adjacent to the input <b>IN.A</b> so we need to write something that retrieves the\r\n        input and do something with it. <code class=\"github-code\">MOV UP, DOWN</code> takes the value of the input and\r\n        moves it to the box below.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Moving on to the box in the middle of the second row, we get the input value that was passed through the previous\r\n        box. <code class=\"github-code\">MOV UP, ACC</code> moves the value into the accumulator <i>ACC</i> of that box,\r\n        effectively storing the value into its memory. The box now moves onto the second command: <code\r\n            class=\"github-code\">ADD ACC</code>. <code class=\"github-code\">ADD</code> will add the parameter value to the\r\n        value of the accumulator and store it there. For example if the accumulator stores the value 5 and it runs <code\r\n            class=\"github-code\">ADD 2</code>, the accumulator will now store the value 7. Executing <code\r\n            class=\"github-code\">ADD ACC</code> means: get the current value of the accumulator, add that to the current\r\n        value of the accumulator and store the result to the accumulator (overwriting the previously stored value). This\r\n        effectively doubles the stored value in the accumulator. Afterwards we move on to the last line of the box:\r\n        <code class=\"github-code\">MOV ACC, DOWN</code> which means take the value of the accumulator and move it to the\r\n        box below.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Similarly in the remaining two boxes we pass the value to <b>OUT.A</b> on the bottom right. When a box finishes\r\n        the last line it jumps back to the first line. If we run the program with this solution the first box will take\r\n        the first input value, pass it down to the box below. It then takes the second value and passes it to the box\r\n        below and so on. Running the program will signal that all tests have passed and show a screen with statistics on\r\n        our performance:</p>\r\n\r\n    <img class=\"img-fluid rounded mb-4\" src=\"assets/images/tis100_lvl2_basic_solution.png\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n    <p>While this solution works, we are not particularly happy with it. Think back about the middle box, which does all\r\n        the heavy weight lifting. It needs to execute 3 lines of codes compared to the other boxes, which only need to\r\n        execute 1. When the box on the first row takes the second input value, it is unable to pass this onto the box in\r\n        the second row yet because it is still processing the first value.

That's a lot of time spent\r\n        doing nothing.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>Now we get to the real meat of the game: how can I make my solution <i>faster</i> or <i>use fewer lines of\r\n        code</i>? Usually it will be a choice between one of these two optimizations. Let's try to\r\n        improve the solution with processing speed in mind.

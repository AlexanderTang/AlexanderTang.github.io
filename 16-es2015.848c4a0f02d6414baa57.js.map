Basically the game features puzzles that you need to solve\r\n        by chaining hardware components together. Each component can be implemented by a set of low level programming\r\n        instructions.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The tutorial level is the best example to illustrate this. The following image shows the expected output:</p>\r\n\r\n    <img class=\"img-fluid rounded mb-4\" src=\"assets/images/shenzhen_io/output.png\" alt=\"\">\r\n\r\n    <p>The <i>active</i> component expects a 0 signal for 6 seconds, then 100 signal for another 6 seconds and rinse\r\n        repeat.

Part of the fun\r\n        is not just finding the solution, but finding an optimal one. Different types of components have a different\r\n        price, so\r\n        you could try and optimize in terms of cost. Or you could optimize in terms of power usage. If you have friends\r\n        on Steam who play this game, you can compare high scores at the end. This may add a bit of competitiveness if\r\n        that motivates you.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>The amount of instructions in this game are more extensive than the ones in TIS-100. This makes the learning\r\n        curve\r\n        in terms of the commands available more steep in Shenzhen I/O, but it allows more complex problems to be tackled\r\n        as well. The limited amount of instruction space in TIS-100 and the fact that things like multiplication took\r\n        so many instructions was definitely a limiting factor in the scope of problems that could be solved for that\r\n        game.

After clicking through them several times I\r\n        noticed that the distributions are fixed and based on a handful of pre-built templates. In the picture above you\r\n        can see which distribution I have picked since the numbers are colored green. We start off with 3 points in\r\n        knowledge, vigilance, wisdom and\r\n        strength. I thought it may be a good idea to invest in skills that improve information gathering. Uncovering\r\n        more quests/encounters typically means more loot and more experience points. It may also provide us with extra\r\n        clues when we get stuck.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p>That is it.
